Background
==========
Sequence data is provided for all single organism genome assemblies that are 
included in NCBI's Assembly resource (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/).  This 
includes submissions to databases of the International Nucleotide Sequence 
Database Collaboration, which are available in NCBI's GenBank database, as well 
as the subset of those submissions that are included in NCBI's RefSeq Genomes 
project. 

Available by anonymous FTP at:
     ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/

Please refer to README files and the FTP FAQ for additional information:

=====================================================================
Genome sequence and annotation data is provided in three directories:
=====================================================================
1) all:     content is the union of GenBank and RefSeq assemblies. The two 
            directories under "all" are named for the accession prefix (GCA or
            GCF) and these directories contain another three levels of 
            directories named for digits 1-3, 4-6 & 7-9 of the assembly 
            accession. The next level is the data directories for individual 
            assembly versions. Only data directories for "latest" assemblies
            are refreshed when annotation is updated or when software updates
            are released, so new file formats or improvements to existing 
            formats are not available for non-latest assemblies.
2) genbank: content includes primary submissions of assembled genome sequence 
            and associated annotation data, if any, as exchanged among members 
            of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration, 
            of which NCBI's GenBank database is a member. The GenBank directory 
            area includes genome sequence data for a larger number of organisms 
            than the RefSeq directory area; however, some assemblies are 
            unannotated. The sub-directory structure includes:
            a. archaea
            b. bacteria
            c. fungi
            d. invertebrate
            e. metagenomes
            f. other -  this directory includes synthetic genomes
            g. plant
            h. protozoa
            i. vertebrate_mammalian
            j. vertebrate_other
3) refseq:  content includes assembled genome sequence and RefSeq annotation 
            data. All prokaryotic and eukaryotic RefSeq genomes have annotation. 
            RefSeq annotation data may be calculated by NCBI annotation  
            pipelines or propagated from the GenBank submission. The RefSeq 
            directory area includes fewer organisms than the GenBank directory
            area because not all genome assemblies are selected for the RefSeq
            project.
            Sub-directories include:
            a. archaea
            b. bacteria
            c. fungi
            d. invertebrate
            e. plant
            f. protozoa
            g. vertebrate_mammalian
            h. vertebrate_other 
            i. viral
            j. mitochondrion [Content of the mitochondrion, plasmid and plastid
            k. plasmid     directories is from the RefSeq release FTP site. See 
            l. plastid     ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/README]

Data are further organized within each of the above directories as a series of 
directories named as the species binomial. For example:
   ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/genbank/bacteria/Escherichia_coli/
           - or - 
   ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/vertebrate_mammalian/Homo_sapiens/

The next hierarchy provides access to all assemblies for the species, latest 
assemblies, and selected reference or representative assemblies for the species 
(if any). Within these groupings, sequence and annotation (and other) data is 
provided per assembly in a series of directories that are named using the rule:

   [Assembly accession.version]_[assembly name]

For example, the directory hierarchy for the GenBank Escherichia coli K-12 
subst. MG1655 genome, which has the assembly accession GCA_000005845.2 and 
default assembly name ASM584v2 looks like this:  
   /genomes/genbank/bacteria/Escherichia_coli/all_assembly_versions/GCA_000005845.2_ASM584v2  

The directory hierarchy for the RefSeq annotated human reference genome which 
has the assembly accession GCF_000001405.30 and assembly name GRCh38.p4 looks 
like this:
   /genomes/refseq/vertebrate_mammalian/Homo_sapiens/all_assembly_versions/GCF_000001405.30_GRCh38.p4

Genome assemblies of interest can be identified using the NCBI Assembly resource
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly), or by using the assembly summary report files 
that are provided for both all genbank and all refseq assemblies:
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ASSEMBLY_REPORTS/assembly_summary_genbank.txt
or ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/genbank/assembly_summary_genbank.txt
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ASSEMBLY_REPORTS/assembly_summary_refseq.txt
or ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/assembly_summary_refseq.txt

Assembly summary report files containing information on assemblies for a 
particular taxonomic group or species are provided in the group and 
Genus_species directories under the "genbank" and "refseq" directory trees. e.g.
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/genbank/bacteria/assembly_summary.txt
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/archaea/Sulfolobus_islandicus/assembly_summary.txt

Search the meta-data fields, or filter the files, to find assemblies of 
interest.


===========================

       Tab-delimited text file reporting the location of genomic regions and 
       the alt/patch scaffolds placed within those regions.
   *_assembly_structure directory
       This directory will only be present if the assembly has internal 
       structure. When present, it will contain AGP files that define how 
       component sequences are organized into scaffolds and/or chromosomes. 
       Other files define how scaffolds and chromosomes are organized into 
       non-nuclear and other assembly-units, and how any alternate or patch 
       scaffolds are placed relative to the chromosomes. Refer to the README.txt
       file in the assembly_structure directory for additional information.
   *_cds_from_genomic.fna.gz
       FASTA format of the nucleotide sequences corresponding to all CDS 
       features annotated on the assembly, based on the genome sequence. See 
       the "Description of files" section below for details of the file format.
   *_feature_table.txt.gz
       Tab-delimited text file reporting locations and attributes for a subset 
       of annotated features. Included feature types are: gene, CDS, RNA (all 
       types), operon, C/V/N/S_region, and V/D/J_segment. Replaces the .ptt & 
       .rnt format files that were provided in the old genomes FTP directories.
       See the "Description of files" section below for details of the file 
       format.
   *_genomic.fna.gz file
       FASTA format of the genomic sequence(s) in the assembly. Repetitive 
       sequences in eukaryotes are masked to lower-case (see below).
       The FASTA title is formatted as sequence accession.version plus 
       description. The genomic.fna.gz file includes all top-level sequences in
       the assembly (chromosomes, plasmids, organelles, unlocalized scaffolds,
       unplaced scaffolds, and any alternate loci or patch scaffolds). Scaffolds
       that are part of the chromosomes are not included because they are
       redundant with the chromosome sequences; sequences for these placed 
       scaffolds are provided under the assembly_structure directory.
   *_genomic.gbff.gz file
       GenBank flat file format of the genomic sequence(s) in the assembly. This
       file includes both the genomic sequence and the CONTIG description (for

=====================
Description of files:
=====================

Masking of fasta sequences in genomic.fna.gz files
--------------------------------------------------
Repetitive sequences in eukaryotic genome assembly sequence files, as 
identified by WindowMasker (Morgulis A, Gertz EM, Schaffer AA, Agarwala R. 
2006. Bioinformatics 22:134-41), have been masked to lower-case.

Alignment programs typically have parameters that control whether the program 
will ignore lower-case masking, treat it as soft-masking (i.e. only for finding 
initial matches) or treat it as hard-masking. By default NCBI BLAST will ignore 
lower-case masking but this can be changed by adding options to the blastn 
command-line.
To have blastn treat lower-case masking in the query sequence as soft-masking 
add:
     -lcase_masking
To have blastn treat lower-case masking in the query sequence as hard-masking 
add:
     -lcase_masking -soft_masking false

Alternatively, commands such as the following can be used to generate either 
unmasked sequence or sequence masked with Ns.

Example commands to remove lower-case masking:
perl -pe '/^[^>]/ and $_=uc' genomic.fna > genomic.unmasked.fna
  -or-
awk '{if(/^[^>]/)$0=toupper($0);print $0}' genomic.fna > genomic.unmasked.fna

Example commands to convert lower-case masking to masking with Ns (hard-masked):
perl -pe '/^[^>]/ and $_=~ s/[a-z]/N/g' genomic.fna > genomic.N-masked.fna
  -or-
awk '{if(/^[^>]/)gsub(/[a-z]/,"N");print $0}' genomic.fna > genomic.N-masked.fna


*_cds_from_genomic.fna.gz & *_rna_from_genomic.fna.gz
-----------------------------------------------------
FASTA sequences of individual features annotated on the genomic records. The 
sequences are based solely on the genome sequence and annotated feature at a
particular location. They may differ from the product sequences found in the 
*_rna.fna.gz and *_protein.faa.gz files which may be based on transcript or 
other data sources and include mismatches, indels, or additional sequence not 
found at a particular genomic location.

Seq-ids are constructed based on the following rule to ensure uniqueness:
lcl|<genomic accession.version>_<feature_type>_<product accession.version>_<counter>
Note the seq-id is not intended to be stable if the annotation is updated; in 
particular, addition or removal of feature(s) will cause the counter to change 
on following features.

The remainder of the FASTA definition line is composed of a series of qualifiers
bounded by brackets, as described at:
  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/modifiers.html
  The qualifiers that may appear in these files are:
	     gene
	     locus_tag
	     db_xref
	     protein
	     product
	     ncRNA_class
	     pseudo
	     pseudogene
	     frame
	     partial
	     transl_except
	     exception
	     protein_id
	     location

Note that some qualifier values such as product names may themselves contain 
un-escaped brackets, which should be allowed for if parsing the files.
		 
For CDS features that begin in frame 2 or 3, the first 1 or 2 bp of sequence
are trimmed from the CDS FASTA so that it always begins with the first complete
codon. The location and frame qualifiers are left unaltered; consequently, the 
length of the ranges in the location string may be 1-2 bp longer than the FASTA 
sequence.

For RefSeq assemblies annotated by NCBI's Eukaryotic Genome Annotation 
Pipeline, a gene may have a frameshifting indel(s) in the genome that is 
thought to result from a genome sequencing error; in these cases, the gene is 
still considered to be protein-coding and annotated with mRNA and CDS features, 
but the genome sequence won't translate correctly downstream from the 
frameshift. To compensate, the FASTA sequence of the genomic CDS and RNA 
features is modified with 1-2 bp gaps (aka "micro-introns") in order to 
restore the predicted reading frame. This modification is reflected by 1-2 bp 
micro-introns in the location qualifier. An equivalent modification is also
made in the *_genomic.gff.gz file. A protein-coding gene may also be annotated
with a CDS feature containing an in-frame stop codon that is translated as a
selenocysteine, subject to stop-codon readthrough, or thought to result from a
genome sequencing error; in these cases, a transl_except qualifier is provided
indicating the genomic location of the stop codon and its proposed translation.
For more details, see the section on "Annotation accommodations for putative 
assembly errors" in:
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/README_GFF3.txt

Pseudogenes annotated with CDS features may be included in the 
*_cds_from_genomic.fna.gz file, and have FASTAs that are disrupted by 
frameshifting indels or in-frame stop codons. Pseudogene features can be
identified and screened out based on the presence of a [pseudo=true] qualifier
in the defline.


*_feature_table.txt.gz
----------------------
Tab-delimited text file reporting locations and attributes for a subset of 
annotated features. Included feature types are: gene, CDS, RNA (all types), 
operon, C/V/N/S_region, and V/D/J_segment. 

The file is tab delimited (including a #header) with the following columns:
col 1: feature: INSDC feature type
col 2: class: For ncRNA features, this is the ncRNA_class for the feature. For 
       gene features, this is the gene biotype computed based on the set of 
       child features for that gene. See the description of the gene_biotype 
       attribute in the GFF3 documentation for more details:
       ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/README_GFF3.txt
col 3: assembly: assembly accession.version
col 4: assembly_unit: name of the assembly unit, such as "Primary Assembly", 
       "ALT_REF_LOCI_1", or "non-nuclear"
col 5: seq_type: sequence type, computed from the "Sequence-Role" and 
       "Assigned-Molecule-Location/Type" in the *_assembly_report.txt file. The
       value is computed as:
       if an assembled-molecule, then reports the location/type value. e.g. 
       chromosome, mitochondrion, or plasmid
       if an unlocalized-scaffold, then report "unlocalized scaffold on <type>".
       e.g. unlocalized scaffold on chromosome
       else the role, e.g. alternate scaffold, fix patch, or novel patch
col 6: chromosome
col 7: genomic_accession
col 8: start: feature start coordinate (base-1). start is always less than end
col 9: end: feature end coordinate (base-1)
col10: strand
col11: product_accession: accession.version of the product referenced by this 
       feature, if exists
col12: non-redundant_refseq: for bacteria and archaea assemblies, the 
       non-redundant WP_ protein accession corresponding to the CDS feature. May
       be the same as column 11, for RefSeq genomes annotated directly with WP_
       RefSeq proteins, or may be different, for genomes annotated with 
       genome-specific protein accessions (e.g. NP_ or YP_ RefSeq proteins) that
       reference a WP_ RefSeq accession.
col13: related_accession: for eukaryotic RefSeq annotations, the RefSeq protein
       accession corresponding to the transcript feature, or the RefSeq 
       transcript accession corresponding to the protein feature.
col14: name: For genes, this is the gene description or full name. For RNA, CDS,
       and some other features, this is the product name.
col15: symbol: gene symbol
col16: GeneID: NCBI GeneID, for those RefSeq genomes included in NCBI's Gene 
       resource
col17: locus_tag
col18: feature_interval_length: sum of the lengths of all intervals for the 
       feature (i.e. the length without introns for a joined feature)
col19: product_length: length of the product corresponding to the 
       accession.version in column 11. Protein product lengths are in amino acid
       units, and do not include the stop codon which is included in column 18.
       Additionally, product_length may differ from feature_interval_length if 
       the product contains sequence differences vs. the genome, as found for 
       some RefSeq transcript and protein products based on mRNA sequences and 
       also for INSDC proteins that are submitted to correct genome 
       discrepancies.
col20: attributes: semi-colon delimited list of a controlled set of qualifiers.
       The list currently includes:
       partial, pseudo, pseudogene, ribosomal_slippage, trans_splicing, 
       anticodon=NNN (for tRNAs), old_locus_tag=XXX 


annotation_hashes.txt
---------------------
Tab-delimited text file reporting hash values and change dates for specific 
details of the annotation. Hashes are computed based on the underlying data in 
ASN.1 format, and thus aren't affected by changes in file formats. In contrast,
the checksums reported in the md5checksums.txt file will change with any change
to the files, including file formats and differences in gzip compression. The
hashes are useful to monitor for when annotation has changed in a way that is 
significant for a particular use case and warrants downloading the updated 
records.

The file is tab delimited (including a #header) with the following columns:
col 1: Assembly accession: accession.version
col 2: Descriptors hash: hash of all descriptors on top-level sequence records,
       including BioSource, molinfo, user objects, publications, and dates
col 3: Descriptors last changed: date and time of the last change to any 
       descriptors
col 4: Features hash: hash of all features annotated on the assembly, including
       both locations and qualifiers stored directly on the genome records. For
       RefSeq genomes annotated with WP proteins and some other cases, protein
       product names aren't stored on the genome records and thus changes in 
       protein names do not alter the features hash.
col 5: Features last changed: date and time of the last change to any features
col 6: Locations hash: hash of just the locations of all features annotated on
       the assembly.
col 7: Locations last changed: date and time of the last change to any feature
       locations
col 8: Protein names hash: hash of the protein names for all CDS features 
       annotated on the assembly.
col 9: Protein names last changed: date and time of the last change to any 
       protein names.

Example use cases:
  A change in the Locations hash indicates that at least one feature has been 
     added, removed, or had its location altered.
  A change in the Features hash but not the Locations hash implies that only
     feature qualifiers have changed, such as names or db_xrefs.
  A change in the Protein names hash indicates that at least one protein name
     has changed compared to the previous files provided on the genomes FTP 
     site. Note for RefSeq prokaryotic genomes, protein names are updated 
     continuously but files on the FTP site are only refreshed intermittently
     to minimize churn.
  A change in the Descriptors hash but not the Features hash implies that only
     record metadata has been touched, such as the addition of a publication.

NOTE: currently the descriptors hash values are not stable due to a bug.


assembly_status.txt
